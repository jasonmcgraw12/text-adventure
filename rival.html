Mostly though you feel scared of what comes next, or is this excitement? After what feels like days you see a ship in the distance. If you can get their attention maybe they could feed you and take you home. You sail over there but before long you see that they have skulls on their sails. What do you do? (have a final decision that they make to either escape home or not)</p>
