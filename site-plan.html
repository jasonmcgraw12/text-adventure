      <h3>Home page (Arrival)</h3>
      <p>
        A veil of clouds obscures any view. You’ve always loved climbing as high as you can go. It’s amazing to feel like you’re on top of the world. Even though you’re technically higher than you’ve ever been before, riding in a plane just doesn’t give you the same rush. It’s been 4 hours and you’re getting restless. What do you do? (present the viewer with different choices leading to different outcomes here)

      <h3>Survival</h3>
      <p>
        You slowly wake up. First you hear the soft sound of waves. Following this you hear a calming rustle of wind rush past you and into the leaves of the trees. Finally you open your eyes to find you’re on a stranded island. What do you do? (present viewer with different survival options here)

        <ul></ul>
      <h3>Rival</h3>
      <p>
        On your trusty boat you sail away from your island. In a way you feel sorry you have to leave. Mostly though you feel scared of what comes next, or is this excitement?

        After what feels like days you see a ship in the distance. If you can get their attention maybe they could feed you and take you home. You sail over there but before long you see that they have skulls on their sails. What do you do? (have a final decision that they make to either escape home or not)
